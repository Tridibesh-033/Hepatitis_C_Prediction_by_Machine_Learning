# Hepatitis C Prediction Using Feature Selection by Machine Learning Technique
## I worked on this research with three other researchers. It was presented at the International Conference ICCRET 2023 at Brainware University and later published as a book chapter by IGI Global Publishers in 2024.
Early disease prediction is crucial for timely medical intervention. This study proposes a machine learning-based framework for Hepatitis C detection using a Kaggle dataset of 564 patients with 12 features. We compare models with and without Gain Ratio Attribute Evaluation (GRAE) for feature selection. Classifiers including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, and MLP are evaluated. Results show that GRAE-based selection improves classification accuracy, with Decision Tree and Random Forest achieving 100% accuracy using only six features.
